### Having issues?

If you're having issues with this repository, be sure to open an issue report on ***this*** github repo and not on the creators of the app's repo (unless you're having an issue with a specific app).

### What is the goal of this project?

The Raspberry Pi is a great and capable little computer. But what frustrates me is how little effort the Raspberry Pi Foundation puts into their Debian package repositories. While some software does work, other software either is extremely outdated or just may not work at all. This repository aims to fix that, or to the best of my ability.

### Would you like to help?
